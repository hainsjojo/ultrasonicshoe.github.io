Hi, am Hains Jojo, studying in grade 12. Last year me and my friend decided to make a shoe and stick for the blind as our project for science fair, it had ultrasonic sensors which would help the blind person to detect any obstacle on his path.. we also added gps system and one-click call features on a belt which could be worn by the blind. Our teachers were very interested in our project, they encouraged us to participate in science fairs conducted by different universities. We participated in 4 universities and won all 4 of them. We hosted a website before for this project, showing the working principals and how it can be made by anyone. As the 1 year limit for that website is over.. We are looking for a new host. Hope we get to host our website here :)
Thank you in advance.
